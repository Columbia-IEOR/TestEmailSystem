# TestEmailSystem
I want to create an, "Email Advising System"  to ease the worrkload of the academic advising team answering routine queries that the advisors receive, it is important to address this via an email system that reads the queries and generates a response. If the email system is 95% confident of the solution the responses will be sent automatically else, the draft response will be sent to the advising team to review and send. 

It should be user-friendly, and high-quality.
